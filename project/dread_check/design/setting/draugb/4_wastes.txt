walking through a black doorway causes you to cease; 10 seconds of darkness then your computer shuts down
walking through a shining door disconnects your wifi and separates you from your actor who walks into the distance,
you can only return through the now dark doorway to cease
when you are being chased by an enemy of fairy the fairy can use magic to activate runes around the door,
for a brief glowing moment this leads you into a dark shortcut that doesn't kill you
the door fades quickly leading enemies into oblivion
