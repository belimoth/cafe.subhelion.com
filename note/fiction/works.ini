# While put forward as posthumous collaborations while Derleth was alive, the status of these works as collaborations with Lovecraft was swiftly disputed after Derleth’s death. Subsequent critics consider them part of the Cthulhu Mythos, but often split this into the original "Lovecraft Mythos" and the later and lesser "Derleth Mythos".[2]

# Unknown authorship
# "The Inevitable Conflict". This was published in Amazing Stories (December 1930 and January 1931) under the name Paul H. Lovering. A variety of evidence, including statistical analysis of the writing structure, has been put forward to suggest that Lovecraft was not the author.[3]

# The Virginia Edition, a 46-volume hardcover collection of all of Robert Heinlein's stories, novels, and nonfiction writing, plus a selection of his personal correspondence, was announced by Meisha Merlin Publishing in April 2005; the Robert A. and Virginia Heinlein Prize Trust (which now owns the Heinlein copyrights) instigated the project. Meisha Merlin went out of business in May 2007 after producing six volumes: I Will Fear No Evil, Time Enough for Love, Starship Troopers, For Us, the Living, The Door into Summer, and Double Star.
# The Heinlein Prize Trust then decided to publish the edition itself, having formed the Virginia Edition Publishing Co. for this purpose. As was true for the Meisha Merlin effort, individual volumes are not offered; subscribers must purchase the entire 46-volume set. The final five volumes (including two volumes of screenwriting, both produced and unproduced) were shipped to subscribers in June 2012.
# In July 2007, the Heinlein Prize Trust opened the online Heinlein Archives, which allows people to purchase and download items from the Heinlein Archive previously stored at the University of California-Santa Cruz. The Trust makes grants available to those using the archives for scholarly purposes.

Reviewer Jen Gunnels writes, "The performance juxtaposed some of Tiptree's short stories with Converse's songs, mixing in biographical elements of both women while kinesthetically exploring both through dance and aerial work on trapeze, lyra (an aerial ring), and silks (two lengths of fabric which the artist manipulates to perform aerial acrobatics). The result was elegant, eerie, and deeply moving."[35][36]

[barefoot-in-the-head]
title  = Barefoot in the Head
date   = 1969
author = Brian Aldiss
format = novel
plot   = Perhaps Aldiss's most experimental work, this first appeared in several parts as the Acid Head War series in New Worlds. Set in a Europe some years after a flare-up in the Middle East led to Europe being attacked with bombs releasing huge quantities of long-lived hallucinogenic drugs. Into an England with a population barely maintaining a grip on reality comes a young Serb, who himself starts coming under the influence of the ambient aerosols, and finds himself leading a messianic crusade. The narration and dialogue reflects the shattering of language under the influence of the drugs, in mutating phrases and puns and allusions, in a deliberate echo of Finnegans Wake.

# In 2020 Amber Limited released the short stories as a collection titled Seven Tales in Amber with an introduction by Warren Lapine.
# The latter five of these stories form one tale set after Prince of Chaos, so they are latest in Amber history.
# All 10 novels have been published in a single omnibus form as The Great Book of Amber and six of the seven short stories were collected in Manna from Heaven. A sex scene deleted from The Guns of Avalon has been published in Collected Stories, volume 3,[5] while the seven Amber short tales appear in volume 6.
# Zelazny collaborated on a companion book, The Visual Guide to Castle Amber (1988), by Zelazny and Neil Randall, illustrated by Todd Cameron Hamilton and James Clouse.[6] The Guide is a reference work providing biographical detail on the Amber characters and a walk-through guide to Castle Amber itself.
# John Betancourt has written a series of novels set in the Amber multiverse set several centuries before Nine Princes in Amber. Betancourt's series tells the story of Corwin's father Oberon, a wizard and shapeshifter. That the Zelazny estate authorized the series has caused some controversy; see "The Chronicles of Amber" for more details.
# An interactive fiction computer game based on Nine Princes in Amber was released by Telarium in 1987. The Amber novels also inspired a unique role-playing game, lacking any random element: Amber Diceless Roleplaying, published by Phage Press.

# "Descendant". Originally published in the anthology Tales from the Forbidden Planet, Roz Kaveney (ed.) 1987, Titan Books, ISBN 1-85286-004-9.

# "Cleaning Up". Originally published in a limited edition of 500 by Birmingham Science Fiction Group as the Souvenir Book for Novacon 17 (1987) when Banks was Guest of Honour.
# An alien race discovers that a faulty teleporter has been sending junk onto the surface of Earth instead of the Sun, where scientists from across the world have been studying these "Gifts." The aliens covertly work with national authorities to recover the futuristic technologies. The last Gift to arrive is the malfunctioning teleporter itself, which the United States attempts to use for a first strike against the USSR. The teleporter fails and randomly sends nuclear devices across the world, devastating several nations.

# A commentary on religion and fundamentalism in the form of a recovered letter from the Lockerbie disaster.
# "The State of the Art". An original edition appeared in 1989 as a separate book (Mark V. Ziesing, ISBN 0-929480-06-6). The cover art was by Arnie Fenner, and a limited edition of 400 books in a slipcase appeared, signed by both artist and author.
# At 100 pages long, the title novella makes up the bulk of the book. The novella chronicles a Culture mission to Earth in the late 1970s, and also serves as a prequel of sorts to Use of Weapons by featuring two of that novel's characters, Diziet Sma and the drone Skaffen-Amtiskaw. Here, Sma argues for contact with Earth, to try to fix the mess the human species has made of it; another Culture citizen, Linter, goes native, choosing to renounce his Culture body enhancements so as to be more like the locals; and Li, who is a Star Trek fan, argues that the whole "incontestably neurotic and clinically insane species" should be eradicated with a micro black hole. The ship Arbitrary has ideas, and a sense of humour, of its own: "Also while I'd been away, the ship had sent a request on a postcard to the BBC's World Service, asking for 'Mr David Bowie's "Space Oddity" for the good ship Arbitrary and all who sail in her.' (This from a machine that could have swamped Earth's entire electro-magnetic spectrum with whatever the hell it wanted from somewhere beyond Betelgeuse.) It didn't get the request played. The ship thought this was hilarious."[2]
# "Scratch". Originally published in The Fiction Magazine vol. 6, No. 6, Jul/Aug 1987.
# A stream-of-consciousness narrative that samples random sections of the future, eventually ending in an abrupt nuclear apocalypse. The following text that opens the story is simultaneously the title and part of the text: "OR: The Present and Future of Species HS (sic) Considered as The Contents of a Contemporary Popular Record (qv). Report Abstract/Extract Version 4.2 Begins (after this break);"

# A trilogy about two countries, Uraba and Tierra, at war with each other. It is set in a world similar to early modern Europe, impacted by such inventions as gunpowder and hot air balloons and by the discovery of hitherto unknown lands and oceans, both countries exploring the world in order to gain an upper hand against the other. One goal is to find the sacred land of Terravitae. However, the fanatic religious war, with each country believing its religion to be the only correct one and the other's a blasphemous heresy and engaging in an escalating series of atrocities, is reminiscent of an earlier historical period, that of the Crusades with its struggle between Medieval Christianity and Islam. The series' Holy City of Ishalem, sacred to both religions and which both kingdoms are utterly determined to possess at all costs, is reminiscent of Medieval attitudes to Jerusalem.

# Anderson and ProgRock Records owner and musician Shawn Gordon created a crossover project called Roswell Six[4] and released the album "Terra Incognita: Beyond The Horizon"[5] with Erik Norlander for book 1 and "Terra Incognita: A Line In The Sand" with Henning Pauly. They combine progressive rock/metal with science fiction lyrics by Anderson and his wife.
